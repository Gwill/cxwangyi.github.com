## What is Docker

Docker is a software that implements the concept of Linux Container,
just like VirtualBox is a software that implements the concept of
Virtual Machines.

Virtual Machines (VirtualBox) | Docker
----------------------------- | ------
VirtualBox                    | dockerd
Virtual machine               | Docker image
A running virtual machine     | Docker container
VBoxManage                    | `docker`

Usually, we create a virtual machine using VirtualBox's GUI.  An
alternative is to use Vagrant, which can execute a script program
step-by-step to create a virtual machine and install software.  We
create a Docker image by letting Docker execute a script file named
`Dockerfile`, which installs software to a base image, usually
donwloaded from Docker Hub, a Web site hosted on Github.

Usually, we are allowed to run only one instance of a virtual machine
on the host computer.  We can run/stop/suspend this instance using
VirtualBox GUI, the `VBoxManager` command line tool, or the `vagrant`
command line tool.

Docker allows us to run many instances of an image.  Each instance is
known as a *container*, which has a GUID and a name.  We can
manipulate containers using command line tool `docker`.  For example,
`docker stop <GUID-or-name>` stops a container and `docker logs
<GUID-or-name>` prints logs generated by programs running in the
container.

We rarely share virtual machines with other users, until recently,
Vagrant makes it easy to upload virtual machines to the Internet and
share with other users.  Docker supports upload and share images, in a
ways similar to how Git manages source code -- every `docker commit`
command generates a new image just like that `git commit` generates a
new commit object, where each commit object contains a version of the
source code.
