<h1>Docker</h1>

<p>Docker is a software that implements the concept of Linux Container,
just like VirtualBox is a software that implements the concept of
Virtual Machines.</p>

<h3>Similarities</h3>

<p>Usually, we create a virtual machine using VirtualBox&rsquo;s GUI.  An
alternative is to use Vagrant, which can execute a script program
step-by-step to create a virtual machine and install software.  We
create a Docker image by letting Docker execute a script file named
<code>Dockerfile</code>, which installs software to a base image, usually
donwloaded from Docker Hub, a Web site hosted on Github.</p>

<p>Usually, we are allowed to run only one instance of a virtual machine
on the host computer.  We can run/stop/suspend this instance using
VirtualBox GUI, the <code>VBoxManager</code> command line tool, or the <code>vagrant</code>
command line tool.</p>

<p>Docker allows us to run many instances of an image.  Each instance is
known as a <em>container</em>, which has a GUID and a name.  We can
manipulate containers using command line tool <code>docker</code>.  For example,
<code>docker stop &lt;GUID-or-name&gt;</code> stops a container and <code>docker logs
&lt;GUID-or-name&gt;</code> prints logs generated by programs running in the
container.</p>

<p>We rarely share virtual machines with other users, until recently,
Vagrant makes it easy to upload virtual machines to the Internet and
share with other users.  Docker supports upload and share images, in a
ways similar to how Git manages source code &ndash; every <code>docker commit</code>
command generates a new image just like that <code>git commit</code> generates a
new commit object, where each commit object contains a version of the
source code.</p>

<h3>Differences</h3>

<p>A Docker image does not contain a set of virtualized hardware as a
virtual machine does; nor does it contain an operating system.
Instead, programs in a Docker container are executed by the host
operating system using the host hardware.</p>

<p>Then, what is the difference of running programs in Docker containers
than on the host computer directly?</p>

<p>A major difference is that each container has its own network port
space.  For example, consider that there is a process P1 listening on
port 5555 in container A, and a process P2 listening on port 5555 in
container B.  Docker would map the port 5555 of P1 to a <em>real</em> port
number of the host, and map 5555 of P2 to another port number of the
host.</p>

<p>Another difference is that processes running in a container accesses
filesystem through <em>volumes</em>.  A volume could be a directory on the
host filesystem but given a difference name, with which, processes in
a container accesses the host directory.</p>
