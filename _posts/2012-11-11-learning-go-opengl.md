To program OpenGL using Go, you can use the `github.com/chsc/gogl`
pacakge.  To install an example of it, simply type

     go get github.com/chsc/gogl/examples/gopher
	 
If you were prompted with an error about missing `glfw`, just install
it.  With Mac OS X, type

     brew install glfw
	 
The screenshot of above example on my OS X 10.8 is as follows:
